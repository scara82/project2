# CURRENCY SWAP
--------------
This project wants to put in contact people that need to change currency without the necessity of going through a bank
(and paying them a fee). In this way everyone can save a little!

the technologies used are:
--------------------------

HTML
CSS
RUBY
RUBY ON RAILS (ACTIVE RECORD)
POSTGRESql database to code

Approach:
---------
I started from my idea and writing the "user story" (you can find it here: https://gist.github.com/scara82/cca612e090c3bb35fc8b5b37d0d4bdc0 ) then I draw the Wireframes of my desired app: (link).

What more:
---------
The deployed application is basic. I want to add few features:
- a phone number authentication when someone sign up. It is about money, even if not directly responsible for what happen after the
user get in touch is desirable having a kind of user identification;
- I want add an API to allow me to give a "live" change rate as a guidance for the user (how much he should expect from the trade);
- A rating system for the user. IF there is an actual trading I want both the user be able to rate the other one.

Where find the application:
