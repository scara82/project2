## CURRENCY SWAP
--------------
This project wants to put in contact people that need to change currency without the necessity of going through a bank
(and paying them a fee). In this way everyone can save a little!
I had myself this need more then once and I used to put an add on Facebook in the page for the Italian community
here in Melbourne but:
- It is limited, it would be great to be connected with the european community here(not only Italians);
- You miss all the people going in Europe (in my case) that are not european (holidays, work,.);
- Having a dedicated channel is always better!

The technologies used are:
--------------------------

- HTML
- CSS
- RUBY
- RUBY ON RAILS (ACTIVE RECORD)
- POSTGRESql database to code

Approach:
---------
I had this idea for a while now so I didn't need to spend time thinking about what to create.
I started to give my idea structure: which information needed so I  created the "user story" to figured out what people needs (my user stories: https://gist.github.com/scara82/cca612e090c3bb35fc8b5b37d0d4bdc0.

 At that point with a rough idea I started to think at the aspect of my application and its layout: I draw the Wireframes of my desired app: http://imgur.com/a/0LJ4k.


What more:
---------
The deployed application is basic. I want to add few features:
- a phone number authentication when someone sign up. It is about money, even if not directly responsible for what happen after the
user get in touch is desirable having a kind of user identification;
- I want add an API to allow me to give a "live" change rate as a guidance for the user (how much he should expect from the trade);
- A rating system for the user. IF there is an actual trading I want both the user be able to rate the other one.

Where find my application:
